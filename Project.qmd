## Python Code

-   Are there any states with a location quotient significantly below 1.0 for artists?

```{python table-setup-py}
# Explicitly import pandas
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Import the dataset
artist = pd.read_csv("artists.csv")
artist.head()

# Delete missing values
artist = artist.dropna()
""" Question1: Are there any states with a location quotient significantly below 1.0 for artists?"""


# Filter the data to include only the relevant columns
subset = artist[['state', 'location_quotient']]

# Visual analysis using a histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(subset['location_quotient'], bins=20, edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Histogram of Location Quotients for Artists')
plt.xlabel('Location Quotient')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()


# Visual analysis using a box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.boxplot(subset['location_quotient'])
plt.title('Location Quotient Distribution for Artists')
plt.xlabel('Artists')
plt.ylabel('Location Quotient')
plt.show()


# Statistical analysis using a one-sample t-test
# Set the significance level for the hypothesis test
alpha = 0.05
population_mean = 1.0  # The hypothesized mean (1.0)

# Perform a one-sample t-test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(subset['location_quotient'], population_mean)

# Filter states with location quotient less than 1.0
states_below_1 = subset[subset['location_quotient'] < 1.0]

# Check if the p-value is less than the significance level
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"States with a location quotient significantly below 1.0 (p-value: {p_value:.4f}): {len(states_below_1)} states")
    
    # Filter the original dataset based on the states with a significantly lower location quotient than 1.0
    filtered_dataset = artist[artist['state'].isin(states_below_1['state'])]
    print("Filtered Dataset:")
    print(filtered_dataset)
else:
    print(f"No significant evidence of location quotients below 1.0. Number of states below 1.0: {len(states_below_1)}")
```

-   The top 10 state /territory has the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.

```{python table-setup-py}
# Sort the dataset by location quotient in descending order
sorted_dataset = artist.sort_values(by='location_quotient', ascending=False)


```
