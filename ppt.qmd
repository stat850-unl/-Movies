## Introduction

::: incremental
-   The Arts Data Profile offers national and state-level estimates of artists in the workforce.
-   Data is sourced from the 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.
-   State-level estimates include the total number of artists and counts for 13 specific artist occupations.
:::

## Objective

::: nonincremental
-   States with a location quotient below 1.0 for artists?
-   The overall distribution of actors across different states?
-   The top 10 states have the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.
-   Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
-   How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states?
-   The top 10 states which has the most number of Asian artists, and the related population percentage.

## Dataset Description

```{r}
# Load the knitr library
library(knitr)

# Insert the plot
knitr::include_graphics("Table of Data.png")
```

## Result for Question 1

***The states having average location quotient less than one***

```{r}


# Insert the plot
knitr::include_graphics("States Having low quotient.png")
```

## Result for Question 1 (cont.)

```{r}

# Insert the plot
knitr::include_graphics("Histogram of average location qutient.png")
```

## Result for Question 2
***The overall distribution of actors across different states***
```{r}

# Insert your favorite plot generated in R
knitr::include_graphics("distribution1.png")
```

## Result for Question 2(cont.)

```{r}

# Insert your favorite plot generated in R
knitr::include_graphics("artist_type_distribution.png")
```

## Result for Question 3
***The top 10 states have the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient***
```{r}

# Insert your favorite plot generated in R
knitr::include_graphics("Top 10 states having high quotient.png")
```

## Result for Question 4
***Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?***

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("correction.png")
```

Correlation Coefficient:
 
 ***-0.0315 (Very Weak Negative Correlation)***

## Result for Question 5
***How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states***
```{r}

# Insert your favorite plot generated in R
knitr::include_graphics("Racial Diversity.jpg")
```

## Result for Question 6
***The top 10 states which has the most number of Asian artists, and the related population percentage***
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("question6.png")
```

## Result for Question 6 (cont.)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("race.png")
```

## Conclusion

1.  The lower location quotients could be influenced by various economic, cultural, and demographic factors. States with diverse economic structures, a focus on industries other than arts and entertainment, or a different cultural emphasis may exhibit lower concentrations of artists.
2.  Lower Concentration of Artists: States with a location quotient below 1.0, as listed, have a lower concentration of artists compared to the national average. This implies that, on average, these states have a smaller proportion of their workforce engaged in artistic occupations compared to the overall distribution across the United States.
3.  Five state are in high in Actors (Arkansa, Florida,Kentucky, New Mexico and Tennessee) and two in low (Arizona, North Carolina)
4.  The negative sign suggests that, on average, as the percentage of artists increases, the state's number of workers tends to decrease slightly. 2. Percentage of artists is not a strong predictor of the overall workforce size. 3. Economic, demographic, or industry-specific factors may contribute to the overall workforce size.
