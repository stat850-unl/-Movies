## Introduction

::: incremental
-   The Arts Data Profile offers national and state-level estimates of artists in the workforce.
-   Data is sourced from the 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.
-   State-level estimates include the total number of artists and counts for 13 specific artist occupations.
:::

## Objective

::: nonincremental
-   States with a location quotient below 1.0 for artists?
-   The overall distribution of actors across different states?
-   The top 10 states have the highest average location quotient.
-   Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
-   How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states?
-   The top 10 states having the most number of Asian artists, and the related population percentage.

## Dataset Description

```{r}
# Load the knitr library
library(knitr)

# Insert the plot
knitr::include_graphics("Table of Data.png")
```

## Result for Question 1

***The states having average location quotient less than one***

```{r}


# Insert the plot
knitr::include_graphics("States Having low quotient.png")
```

## Result for Question 1 (cont.)

```{r}

# Insert the plot
knitr::include_graphics("Histogram of average location qutient.png")
```

## Result for Question 2

***The overall distribution of actors across different states***

```{r}

# Insert your favorite plot generated in R
knitr::include_graphics("distribution1.png")
```

## Result for Question 2(cont.)

```{r}

# Insert your favorite plot generated in R
knitr::include_graphics("artist_type_distribution.png")
```

## Result for Question 3

***The top 10 states have the highest average location quotient***

```{r}

# Insert your favorite plot generated in R
knitr::include_graphics("Top 10 states having high quotient.png")
```

## Result for Question 4

***Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?***

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("correction.png")
```

Correlation Coefficient:

***-0.0315 (Very Weak Negative Correlation)***

## Result for Question 5

***How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states***

```{r}

# Insert your favorite plot generated in R
knitr::include_graphics("Racial Diversity.jpg")
```

## Result for Question 6

***The top 10 states which has the most number of Asian artists, and the related population percentage***

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("question6.png")
```

## Result for Question 6 (cont.)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("race.png")
```

## Conclusion

::: incremental
1.  Location Quotient Analysis: States with a location quotient below 1.0 indicate a lower concentration of artists compared to the national average.
2.  Actors Analysis: Five states are in high in Actors (Arkansa, Florida,Kentucky, New Mexico and Tennessee) and two in low (Arizona, North Carolina).
3.  Artistic Diversity: District of Columbia stands out with a significantly high location quotient of 3.02, suggesting a unique concentration of artists.While West Virginia exhibits the lowest concentration of artists among the states.

## Conclusion (cont.)

::: incremental
4.  Correlation Analysis: No significant correlation is observed between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers.
5.  Diversity Analysis: Hawaii has more diversity compared to other states.
6.  Asian Artist Distribution: California emerges as a leader with the highest number of Asian artists.

## Future Work

::: incremental
1.  Economic and Cultural Factors: Investigate economic and cultural influences contributing to the distribution and location quotients of artists in different states.
2.  Policy Implications: Consider policy implications for states with lower location quotients to promote and support the artistic community.
3.  Long-Term Trends: Analyze long-term trends in the distribution of artists, considering factors such as migration patterns and evolving cultural landscapes.
