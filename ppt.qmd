# Introduction

-   The Arts Data Profile offers national and state-level estimates of artists in the workforce.
-   Data is sourced from the 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.
-   State-level estimates include the total number of artists and counts for 13 specific artist occupations.
-   The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the artistic workforce across different U.S. states.

**Artists**

-   Architects (except landscape and naval); landscape architects; art directors, fine artists, and animators; designers; actors; producers and directors; dancers and choreographers; music directors and composers; musicians; disk jockeys, except radio; entertainers; broadcast announcers and radio disk jockeys; other media and communication workers; writers and authors; and photographers.

**Location Quotients**

The location quotient (LQ) measures the concentration of a particular occupation within a state's labor force, relative to that occupation's concentration in the U.S. labor force. For example, an LQ of 1.2 indicates that the occupation clusters in a state at a level 20 percent greater than within the nation's workforce at large. An LQ of 0.8 indicates that the occupation clusters in a state at a level 20 percent below the occupation's concentration.

## Objective

-   Are there any states with a location quotient significantly below 1.0 for artists?
-   What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
-   The top 10 state /territory has the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.
-   Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
-   How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states or territories? Are there states with a more diverse artist population than others?
-   The top 10 states which has the most number of Asian artists, and the related population percentage.
