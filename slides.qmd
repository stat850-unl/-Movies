##Introduction

The Arts Data Profile provides national and state-level estimates of artists in the workforce, sourced from 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) data conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. State-level estimates cover the total number of artists and individual counts for 13 specific artist occupations. An interactive map displays counts and location quotients for total artists and selected occupations, including architects, arts directors, fine artists, animators, designers, dancers, musicians, actors, entertainers, writers, authors, and photographers for each U.S. state.

### Artists: 

Architects (except landscape and naval); landscape architects; art directors, fine artists, and animators; designers; actors; producers and directors; dancers and choreographers; music directors and composers; musicians; disk jockeys, except radio; entertainers; broadcast announcers and radio disk jockeys; other media and communication workers; writers and authors; and photographers.


### Location Quotients

The location quotient (LQ) measures the concentration of a particular occupation within a state’s labor force, relative to that occupation’s concentration in the U.S. labor force. For example, an LQ of 1.2 indicates that the occupation clusters in a state at a level 20 percent greater than within the nation’s workforce at large. An LQ of 0.8 indicates that the occupation clusters in a state at a level 20 percent below the occupation’s concentration in the U.S. labor force.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objective

-   Are there any states with a location quotient significantly below 1.0 for artists?
-   What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
-   The top 10 state /territory has the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.
-   Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
-   How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states or territories? Are there states with a more diverse artist population than others?
-   Are there any states where the racial composition of artists is significantly different from the overall racial composition of the state's population, and what might explain this difference?

## Question 2:  What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
![The overall distribution of all artist types across different states or territories ](distribution_of_artists_in_the_US.PNG)
 
## Visualization Considerations for Question 2
- Heatmaps are powerful but come with limitations.
 - Challenges include color misinterpretation and difficulty in distinguishing similar shades.
 - Difficulty in interpreting shades.
 - Lack of granularity for specific data points, especially in individual states.
 - Concerns about color scale effectiveness based on data variations.
 Shiny App Solution
- Leveraging Shiny to address heatmap limitations.
- Interactive visualization for detailed analysis.
- Better navigation for exploring specific states and artist types.
