------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objective

-   Are there any states with a location quotient significantly below 1.0 for artists?
-   What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
-   The top 10 state /territory has the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.
-   Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
-   How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states or territories? Are there states with a more diverse artist population than others?
-   The top 10 states which has the most number of Asian artists, and the related population percentage.

## Question 2:  What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
![The overall distribution of all artist types across different states or territories ](distribution_of_artists_in_the_US.PNG)
 
## Visualization Considerations for Question 2
- Heatmaps are powerful but come with limitations.
 - Challenges include color misinterpretation and difficulty in distinguishing similar shades.
 - Difficulty in interpreting shades.
 - Lack of granularity for specific data points, especially in individual states.
 - Concerns about color scale effectiveness based on data variations.
 Shiny App Solution
- Leveraging Shiny to address heatmap limitations.
- Interactive visualization for detailed analysis.
- Better navigation for exploring specific states and artist types.

## Result for question 3
The top 10 state /territory has the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.

## Question 4: Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
The correlation between two variables, x and Y, is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), which is defined by the following formula: 
![](correction.png)
X: the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share)
Y: the state's number of workers (all_workers_n)
The correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to 1:
