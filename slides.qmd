## Objective

-   Are there any states with a location quotient significantly below 1.0 for artists?
-   What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
-   The top 10 state /territory has the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.
-   Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
-   How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states or territories? Are there states with a more diverse artist population than others?
-   Are there any states where the racial composition of artists is significantly different from the overall racial composition of the state's population, and what might explain this difference?
