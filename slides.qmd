##Introduction

## Objective

-   Are there any states with a location quotient significantly below 1.0 for artists?
-   What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
-   The top 10 state /territory has the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.
-   Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
-   How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states or territories? Are there states with a more diverse artist population than others?
-   Are there any states where the racial composition of artists is significantly different from the overall racial composition of the state's population, and what might explain this difference?

## Question 2:  What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
![The overall distribution of all artist types across different states or territories ](distribution_of_artists_in_the_US.PNG)
 
## Visualization Considerations for Question 2
- Heatmaps are powerful but come with limitations.
 - Challenges include color misinterpretation and difficulty in distinguishing similar shades.
 - Difficulty in interpreting shades.
 - Lack of granularity for specific data points, especially in individual states.
 - Concerns about color scale effectiveness based on data variations.
 Shiny App Solution
- Leveraging Shiny to address heatmap limitations.
- Interactive visualization for detailed analysis.
- Better navigation for exploring specific states and artist types.
