Project description:
 In this project, Mahyar Madarshahian and Jing Wang are planning to explore the artists in the U.S.. [This data set (Artists in the U.S.)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-09-27/artists.csv) includes state (the U.S. state where the data was collected), race (the racial or ethnic category of the workforce being analyzed), type (the type of profession or occupation for which the data is recorded), all_workers_n (the total number of workers in the specified state and occupation), artists_n (the number of artists within the same state and occupation), artists_share (the share or proportion of artists among all workers in the occupation within the particular state) and location_quotient (a numerical measure used to assess the concentration of a particular occupation in a specific geographical area).
 
  There are some interesting topics we want to look in the future: 
  \* Are there any states with a location quotient significantly below 0.1 for artists?
  \* The top 10 state /territory has the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.
  \*  What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
  \* Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
  \* How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states or territories? Are there states with a more diverse artist population than others?
  \* Are there any states where the racial composition of artists is significantly different from the overall racial composition of the state's population, and what might explain this difference?
