## Instructions

Each member of your team should modify this document in some way and push their modifications to the repository in a separate commit. This will ensure that you have set your repository up in a way that ensures all group members are working with the same repository.

Please ensure that you have set your git name and email address on your computer by **modifying** the following commands and running them in the terminal:

```         
git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
git config --global user.email "mona@lisa.com"
```

In the proposal as in the final report, all of your code chunks should be set so that `echo = F`, which prevents the code from being printed in the report. You should also set `message = F, warning = F`, which will reduce the amount of additional output which is present in the report. You can customize the execution of code in quarto by using additional options, some of which are detailed [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).

## Data

### Source

The data we are using in this project comes from \[<https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/arts-data-profile-series/adp-31/data-tables>\].

If you cannot link directly to the data file, then you need to additionally describe how someone could acquire the same data:

> You can download the data directly using \[<https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-09-27/artists.csv>\]

Provide some code to read in the data (either stored in the repository or read in directly from the source).

### Description

The dataset contains information about various movies, including movie name, release year, director, age difference between lead actors, the number of couples in the movie, actor names, their respective genders, birthdates, and ages. It was collected from \[mention data source and any specific details about the dataset\].

It was collected from ...

Here is a data dictionary showing each variable, the type of variable, units, and range of values that are possible:

Note: this is an example table, please modify to actually match your data. Ensure that all of the same information is represented.

An LQ of 0.8 indicates that the state's labor force in an occupation is 20 percent below the occupation's national labor force share. |

## Project Goals

Describe why this data is interesting and what you hope to do with it.

We will use \[dataset\](<https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-09-27/artists.csv>) to explore the following topics:

-   The top 10 state /territory has the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.
-   Are there any states with a location quotient significantly below 1.0 for artists?
-   What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
-   Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
-   How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states or territories? Are there states with a more diverse artist population than others?
-   Are there any states where the racial composition of artists is significantly different from the overall racial composition of the state's population, and what might explain this difference?

We expect to create

-   Several summary tables
-   Data visualization (age difference distribution, time series, director influence...)
-   Some interesting findings (race, number of artists, states, ...)
-   ...

## Division of Labor

Describe how you plan to work together as a team. Set intermediate deadlines - what do you plan to have done by the project check-in? The more you have done (report/slides/code), the better feedback I can give you.

## Additional Comments

What concerns do you have about this project? This is your place to provide feedback about the project guidelines and ask clarifying questions for me to address either individually or in class, if the question is relevant to everyone.
