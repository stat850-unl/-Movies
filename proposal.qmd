## Data

### Source

The data we are using in this project comes from [Artists in the U.S.](https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/arts-data-profile-series/adp-31/data-tables)

If you cannot link directly to the data file, then you need to additionally describe how someone could acquire the same data:

> You can download the data directly using [this link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-09-27/artists.csv)

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-09-27/artists.csv"

# Read the data from the URL into a data frame
artists_data <- read.csv(url)
head(artists_data)
```

Provide some code to read in the data (either stored in the repository or read in directly from the source).

### Description

The dataset provides insights into the presence and concentration of Hispanic architects in different states, highlighting variations in workforce demographics and professional diversity across the United States.

It was collected from [Artists in the U.S.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-09-27/artists.csv)

Here is a data dictionary showing each variable, the type of variable, units, and range of values that are possible:

Note: this is an example table, please modify to actually match your data. Ensure that all of the same information is represented.

| variable          | class     | description                                                                                                                          |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| state             | character | This variable represents the U.S. state where the data was collected                                                                 |
| race              | character | This variable specifies the racial or ethnic category of the workforce being analyzed                                                |
| type              | character | This variable indicates the type of profession or occupation for which the data is recorded                                          |
| all_workers_n     | double    | This numeric variable represents the total number of workers in the specified state and occupation                                   |
| artists_n         | double    | This numeric variable signifies the number of artists within the same state and occupation                                           |
| artists_share     | double    | This numeric variable expresses the share or proportion of artists among all workers in the occupation within the particular state   |
| location_quotient | double    | Location quotient is a numerical measure used to assess the concentration of a particular occupation in a specific geographical area |

## Project Goals

Describe why this data is interesting and what you hope to do with it

We will use the dataset from [Artists in the U.S.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-09-27/artists.csv) to explore the following topics:


-   Are there any states with a location quotient significantly below 1.0 for artists?
-   What is the overall distribution of artist types across different states or territories?
-   The top 10 state /territory has the highest number of artists, as indicated by the location quotient.
-   Is there a correlation between the percentage of artists in a state (artists_share) and the state's number of workers?
-   How does the racial diversity of artists vary across different states or territories? Are there states with a more diverse artist population than others?
-   Are there any states where the racial composition of artists is significantly different from the overall racial composition of the state's population, and what might explain this difference?

We expect to create

-   Several summary tables
-   Data visualization (age difference distribution, time series, director influence...)
-   Some interesting findings (race, number of artists, states, ...)
-   ...

## Division of Labor

During the whole project, Mahyar and Jing will collaborate closely and help each other using R and Python.

Task 1: Clean and preprocess dataset

-   Mahyar will set up the the environment, prepare the basic visualization, clean and preprocess the dataset using python
-   Jing Wang will set up the the environment, prepare the basic visualization, clean and preprocess the dataset using R
-   Work together to compare the clean dataset

Task 2: exploring the data, identifying trends, and creating visualizations

-   Mahyar and Jing will explore the data, identify the trends and create the visualizations using Python and R, independently
-   Work together to check the results and findings

Task 3: Creat interactive graphics to enhance data exploration

-   Mahyar will create the necessary table(s) and graphic (s) to enhance data exploration for question 1,3, 5 using python

-   Jing will create the necessary table(s) and graphic (s) to enhance data exploration for question 2, 4, 6 using R

-   Work together to check the tables and graphics.

Task 4: Creat the project report and presentation

-   Mahyar and Jing will work together to finisht he report and presentation and other related tasks.

## Additional Comments

Up to now there is no concern about the project.
